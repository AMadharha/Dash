# Project Description
This is a basic game I created using Java, specifically using JavaFX libraries. It's a simple game where you must dodge the obstacles and collect coins to increase your score. The game keeps track of your highscore, so you can keep playing until you beat your personal best!

# Gameplay/Scenes
This is the **title screen**, this is the screen that it brings you to when you first run the game and play again after you die. You can also check the controls and current high score (local):

This is the **character select screen**, this is where you enter your name and select your character. The character do not have anything unique about them besides then having their own styles! You also must enter your name here, this name cannot be blank and cannot contain a "=". This is the name that is associated with your score.

This is sample **gameplay**. It does look slow, but the game quickens as your score goes up, with the max speed reached at 40 score:

Finally, this is the **end screen** when you die in the game. You can either play again or exit the game:
