# Project Description
This is a basic game I created using Java, specifically using JavaFX libraries. It's a simple game where you must dodge the obstacles and collect coins to increase your score. The game keeps track of your highscore, so you can keep playing until you beat your personal best!

# Gameplay/Scenes
This is the **title screen**, this is the screen that it brings you to when you first run the game and play again after you die:
